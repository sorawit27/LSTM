# Predicting Stock Prices and Trading using Machine Learning

## Abstract

In this projet we will try to develop a model using machine learning techniques to predict stock prices in 2020 given past data. This is an interesting domain of research since there have been many developments in this field, such as the use of Long Short-Term Memories (LSTMs) in stock price prediction, as an extension of using convolutional neural networks. In addition, there's potential for more complex models using deep learning networks with multiple branch architectures, integrating opening/closing stock prices with other technical indicators such as MACD (moving average convergence/divergence). 

This project was partly inspired by previous work done by Yacoub Ahmed [here](https://github.com/yacoubb/stock-trading-ml) and was under the supervision of Professor Christian LÃ³pez Bencosme at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania.

## Algorithms implementations

### Preliminary Analysis

Click [here](https://github.com/sorawit27/Stock-Forecast/blob/master/LSTM_Stock_Forecast.ipynb) to run the Python notebook for a preliminary analysis of some stock data using LSTMs, and using a simple neural network model to try to predict future stock prices.

### Algorithmic Trading: 

Click [here](https://github.com/sorawit27/Stock-Forecast/blob/master/Project_Final.ipynb) to see an attempt of implementing a simple algorithmic trading model that trades stocks when the predicted prices rise above or fall below a certain threshold, and also an attempt of using a multiple-branch architecture to improve the performance of our model.
