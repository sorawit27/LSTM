# Predicting Stock Prices and Trading using Machine Learning

## Abstract

The objective of this project is to develop a method based on Machine Learning algorithms to detect traffic accidents in real-time with the use of traffic cameras. Early accident detection systems can save lives because, after an accident, a quick medical response can mean the difference between life and death. In addition, these systems could mitigate the economic impact of accidents by reducing bottlenecks and possible secondary incidents. 

Although the existing 9-1-1 System allows detecting accidents and providing medical assistance faster than ever before, accident detection technologies could help the system improve its response time and reduce its costs. Unfortunately, existing accident detection methods tend to have low accuracy and high levels of false alarm in complex urban environments, such as those prevailing in the Dominican Republic. Given these limitations and the impact that accident detection systems will have on the Dominican society, this project aims to develop a hybrid multistage method based on Machine Learning and Deep Neural Network algorithms. This method will help detect accidents in real-time, helping save lives, reduce bottlenecks, and reduce the economic impact of accidents. In addition, this proposal will help develop talent in the area of Artificial Intelligence, which is scarce in the Dominican Republic, despite the fact that it has been postulated as an essential area for technological innovation.
