# Predicting Stock Prices and Trading using Machine Learning

## Abstract

In this projet we will try to develop a model using machine learning techniques to predict stock prices in 2020 given past data. This is an interesting domain of research since there have been many developments in this field, such as the use of Long Short-Term Memories (LSTMs) in stock price prediction, as an extension of using convolutional neural networks. In addition, there's potential for more complex models using deep learning networks with multiple branch architectures, integrating opening/closing stock prices with other technical indicators such as MACD (moving average convergence/divergence). 

This project was partly inspired by previous work done by Yacoub Ahmed [here](https://github.com/yacoubb/stock-trading-ml) and was under the supervision of Professor Christian LÃ³pez Bencosme at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania.
